# My Solutions
## To LeetCode Algorithm Problems (1st ver)

- This repo targets to pass all unlocked
  <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/">LeetCode Algorithm Problems</a>
  (focus on accuracy more than efficiency).
<br><br>
- All of them passed the lower time bound tests of LeetCode grader.
<br><br>
- Some of them are not efficient enough that they merely passed the lower bound req.
<br><br>
- Will create a separate repo (2nd ver) to update more efficient valid solutions.
